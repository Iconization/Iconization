        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        <h2>1.1 Preamble</h2>
        <p>Art began in parallel with the genesis of creation where it has been used as a talisman to protect against nature's wrath and mysterious phenomena. Art is developed after crystallization of the religious ideas, until it became a ritual tool for practicing the worships to spread those ideas and beliefs as well. Art, in contrast to the aforementioned, later became a means of expressing freedom from ideologies and beliefs that have monopolized art and artists for many centuries through the emergence of the philosophy "Art for art's sake" or as Théophile Gautier said, "l'art pour l'art", a famous French slogan in the early nineteenth century. Art at that time was a means of expression of liberation and abstraction from all intellectual and social constraints. That role started recedes and retreats in the face of rapid technological development, to this day, where art is experiencing a state of confusion and lack of compass.</p>
        <h2>1.2 Problem background</h2>
        <p>After significant impact of globalization on mankind’s lifestyle, particularly from the mid-twentieth century through the nineties where the information technology revolution and what followed to these days was accompanied and the tremendous development of social media as its applications, in addition to the sensory means of facilities attached to its hardware/software. The upcoming technologies in the next few years of offering digital currencies linked to those applications and their impact on changing human behavior and their social activities (Lawlor, 2007). Here, we can ask; to what extent will art in general have an impact in the near future?</p>
        <p>Especially as we are facing clearly indicators the decay of many traditional, handicraft professions, and their disappearance from the labor market in the near future (Frey & Osborne, 2013), that decay comes in favor of professions that are often associated with information technology and artificial intelligence fields (Rosa, Pereira & Ferretti, 2018). Once again, is there any chance for the art to contribute in future professions?</p>
        <p>In order to answer a rational question like that, we must agree on a formula of the definition of Art consistent with the aspirations of the beneficiaries and the development of human perception in understanding that term, that differed on its definition and agreed on its concept of all societies, whether it was developed or not. The process of formulating a definition itself is not enough, but we must go further to the philosophy behind that definition. This can facilitate the issue for novice artists and art students to preserve the rights of the artist and their products from impurities and fake products promoted here and there as unique/authentic pieces on hand, and it helps us in evaluating the original art works on the other hand.</p>
        <p>Globalization provided great services to humanity, but it ruined many civilization and cultural features that distinguish the identities of people, because it’s codifying communities and their lifestyles within specific ways as a language and dealing with the techniques, clothing, drinks and food habits, all these factors affect the features of the nations and homelands (Getahun, 2019). Consequently, that development was negatively reflected on art and on addressing artistic issues in a manner that adapts to the new atmosphere imposed by globalization</p>
        <h2>1.3 Objectives and goals</h2>
        <p>Filling a gap in knowledge by establishing a philosophical entity, in other words, create a cognitive institution that contributes to the advancement of the arts named iconization, to provide services like explanations term related to art as the nucleus of a project that contributes to the revival of art value, by developing the following tools:</p>
        <p>- Art Reviewing, Criticism and Evaluation</p>
        <p>- Art Purification</p>
        <p>- Art Consolidation</p>
        <p id=SC_0>In order to achieve this complex goal, a strategy proposed as a road map that includes four levels
          of targets:</p>
        <div id=sc_0 style=visibility:hidden>
          <li><b>Short-term target:</b> publishing the philosophy of iconization by social media means (websites, YouTube channels, Facebook pages) and academic methods (presentations, articles, books and conferences)</li>
          <li><b>Mid-term target:</b> establishing a virtual school/institution, iconization school of art</li>
          <li><b>Long-term target:</b> establishing a school/institution of art then move to the fieldwork</li>
          <li><b>Ultimate target:</b> establish an international organization shall be a supervisory, supportive, reward giver, and assessor of artwork, carry iconization logo as a reference/classification that reflect the sobriety of the artworks.</li>
        </div>
        <h1>2. iconization </h1>
        <p>Within the art space, iconization as a concept, not a clear linguistic term, emerged as a reaction to globalization, where the globalization began to dictate its tools to dress the material and cultural worlds in a uniform, breaking the walls of cultures, nation’s identities and traditions through advanced facilities and means of physical and social communication (Mohamad & Walker, 2019).</p>
        <h2 id=ST_1>2.1.1 What does iconization mean? (Concepts and Definitions)</h2>
        <p><a id=ST_0>iconization</a>, as a term, came from the root, icon, which reflects the philosophy of this entity to consider the value of the phrase iconically/iconography which is the art work identity; thus iconization getting close to Expressionism and Symbolism movements in general to deliver the artist/performer message. iconization is a proposed institute of art, established to be a platform for artists, designers and art students, provides different art services. iconization adapts to most of the visual arts and mainly focusing on arts of interior design, architecture and urban design and can be extended to include other fields of fine arts and rest of 7 arts. As any institution, iconization adopts its own philosophy, which requires deep understanding for the purpose of art and its role in human civilization. It has been observed in the last few decades that there are deficiencies in the understanding for the term of art even at the level of elite artists or art scholars, especially art movements/schools that followed modern art. Expectations of iconization’s impact on fields such as arts evaluation, education, marketing, life style, social, economy, etc.</p>
        <p>iconization movement assumes that the world is culturally oriented towards the iconography to highlight creative cultural and artistic diversity (Sklair & Leslie, 2017). It thus serves as a reaction to globalization and its effects on the normalization of cultures within a specific global paradigm that causes confusion and the loss of many creative cultural and artistic efforts. In past decades from the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century that the artists in general are in a state of loss due to multiple sources, and the diversity in excess and mechanization of their creative products, which led to what we call intellectual and creative slack or Intellectual sag.</p>
        <h2 id=ST_6>Definition of Art</h2>
        <p>iconization developed its own definition of art to simulate philosophy of this institution, and express its practical orientations. Furthermore, iconization provides an extensive explanation for that definition and definition of forged art to ensure better understanding of the meaning of art, where one of the best ways to understand the idea is to understand its antithesis.</p>
        <p>“Art define: as an authentic and intended human activity, objective and not futility, expressing ideas in creative ways that reflect skills and experience of it performer/s, within interaction between order and chaos”.</p>
        <p>As the most quality artwork is the one, in which the recipient interacts with the artist's idea. The
          last part of the definition of art, which we think is the most questionable part of the phrase
          "interaction between order and chaos". In this part of the definition, the sensory side includes all
          artworks, where every unique artwork has a balance between order and chaos.</p>
        <center><img src=https://i.ibb.co/XjKLdGT/a.png></center>
        <center>Figure 1: Levitated Mass by Heizer 2012, at Los Angeles County museum of art (Perrett, 2016)</center>
        <p>Levitated Mass is a large-scale public art sculpture, built by Michael Heizer in 2012 at Los Angeles County Museum of Art, as it is shown in the figure above. 340-ton boulder sculpture placed above a 456-foot viewing pathway to accommodate 360-degree viewing, where its notable 106-mile transit from the Jurupa Valley Quarry in Riverside County was widely covered by the media (Perrett, 2016). By the way, Levitated mass/rock is a controversial work and it’s been criticized by some senior art like Robert Florczak www.classicalpoets.org. Levitated Mass is one of many examples, which is showing clearly the interaction between order of the base where the systematic tunnel design; and chaos that represented by the nature of the rock’s texture (Williams, Pearce, 2009). The order or uniformity that found at engineering drawing, despite containing elements of an artwork makes it weakly tastefully due to the excessive regularity in lines, angles and so on of systematic shapes. In other example a photograph of a forest or a landscape without any human effect such as buildings or a machine etc, where most of these works are accused of technical weakness as well because of the excessive chaos and its lack of any sensory anthropomorphic reflect the impact of the system in these kind of works.</p>
        <p>Figure 2, showing clearly how the interaction between the order and chaos play a vital role to make the artwork more balanced in same piece of art. We can observe that phase A totally represent the chaos part of the image, where there is no any kind of straight lines, geometrical shape, or feeling indicating a human influence on that part. In contrast to phase B, where the interaction between irregular shapes of tree leaves with the elegant lines of the hut and the boat as well as the lighting inside the hut that reflects the presence of human influence.</p>

          <br>
          Figure 2: Showing the impact between the two phases for the same topic
        </center>
        <p>Let us define the art by its opposition, where the forged art is a title falls under it mostly every handcraft/artwork manufactured profusely for marketing purposes wholesale or imitation of an artistic work. These products devoid of goal or a message but it carries an aesthetic aspect for purpose of deceiving the customer or the victim acquires decorating works, for visual arts or such as substandard works within the audiovisual arts (Vuong, Nguyen, Tran & Manh, 2018).</p>
        <p>It is clearly through the definition above that any aesthetic piece it’s not necessarily considered as artwork. For example, if an animal draws a painting such as a monkey or an elephant that holds a pen or brush in its proboscis and draws colorful picture, then this is only a drawing of an animal and not an artwork. Likewise painting drawn by a professional painter imitating the Mona Lisa or one of famous artwork without adding or developing, whatever the quality of the work, it is not considered as an artwork and every imitated musical or lyrical performance falls under the non- authentic work. Finally and in simple words, the artwork is a creative message from the performer/s to the audience.</p>
        <h2>Design Arts</h2>
        <p>In Planning Curriculum in Art and Design, Melvin F. Pontious suggest an approach to study art and design as described in figure 3.</p>
        <center>
          <img src=https://i.ibb.co/RSL8WnR/1586607402565blob.png>
          <br>
          Figure 3: The Visual Art Thinking approach (Pontious, 2013)
        </center>
        <p>Pontious claimed in his approach that the visual art thinking is the core and he identified the design as a utilitarian art, and the fine art under professional art (Pontious, 2013). In sum, art in general has many aspects, including fine/aesthetic, cultural, communicational/social, and there is a utilitarian aspect. The design is utilitarian art where the design was found to provide a function in addition to the aesthetic value, and the concept of design has always been associated with the functionality, until this concept crystallized in its clear form with the emergence of the Bauhaus, where one of its Key design slogans “Form follow function” in design (Robert, Sean & Andrea, 2001).</p>
        <h2>Design Principles and Elements</h2>
        <p>In order to understanding, the design topic must to know the design principles and elements, in simple word the principles of design result from the relationships of the design elements. Principles of design like Balance, Emphasis, Movement, Pattern, Repetition, Proportion, Rhythm, Variety and Unity. As mentioned above there are many aspects of art and the design also containing a few of minors under term of general design such as interior design, graphic design, industrial design, Etc. There are general design elements such as line, color, shape, texture, form and value (Al-Helly & Ibrahim, 2014).</p>
        <h2 id=ST_2>2.1.2 Why iconization exist?</h2>
        <p>At Erican College in Malaysia, and during my Art and Architecture History class, one of my students asked me about the name of the current art movement or period. I did not find the Contemporary Art is the best answer nor post modern or others terms that we read in art history books, for simple reason there is no recognizable art movement, we simply did not find an art movement that was able to adapt to globalization to produce an artistic mood with distinctive features that could characterize an era that spanned three decades, perhaps more (Westley & Folke, 2018). Everything around us has started to accelerate change, so why do we find a painter or sculptor today who ruminates topics and forms of application of his works from art schools spanning centuries? Understanding iconization definition and principles above are establishing a fundamental base to build the objectives on it. As mentioned above, the artist today lives in a state of loss and confusion, and this reflects even on the financial returns of artistic products due to the large number of counterfeiting, the entry of the machine and the ease of reproducing those products (Gray, Figueroa & Barnes 2009). The process of designing jewelry goes through several stages, starting from extracting raw materials, then designing the piece and then marketing it. The most important thing that drives the customer to acquire that piece is the designer or manufacturer who creatively turned a piece of metal or stone into a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the designer is the least beneficiary of the price of this piece.</p>
        <p>According to www.payscale.com, the average senior buyer annual salary is $70,188 in southern California; while the average jewelry designer annual salary is $54,814. In fact, the jewelry annual income started from $28k. iconization aims to contribute to highlighting and reviewing the researches written in this regard to come up with ideas that include job opportunities for young artists to keep up with the path because they are like professional sports stars and they have the same role in society, so they deserve the same amount of care and support. All that through several considerations:</p>
        <li>iconization came to answer a couple of questions regarding to art movements/periods and how that will help lecturers, student and researchers who work in fields of art to clearly understanding and explaining the current and near future art periods and directions.</li>
        <li>iconization help beginner artists and art students to identifying their practical target when they decide to get a first step to build their professional portfolio.</li>
        <li>iconization helps organizations and companies to deal with art and art materials as a
          recognizable theme where that will be reflected on the value of art and artists in their
          communities.</li>
        <h2 id=ST_3>2.1.3 How iconization will be launched?</h2>
        <p id=SC_1>There are a few of practical means will be taken for publishing/spreading iconization philosophy:</p>
        <div id=sc_1 style=visibility:hidden>
          <li>Social media platform/promotional</li>
          <p>- Website, Social media and gaming platform</p>
          <li>Work on organizing a conference as soon as the project is been finalized.</li>
          <li>virtual (e-learning/open education/online study) art institution, works on 3 lines:</li>
          <p>- iconization Art certificate business/self employ line</p>
          <p>- Furniture and antiques evaluation services certificate (museums & auction houses) organizations line</p>
          <p>- Interactive methods of teaching art history educational line</p>
        </div>
        <h2>2.2 iconization principles:</h2>
        <p>- Art expressing Identity of the work</p>
        <p>- Every artwork is devoid of a message that does not classified as a sober artwork</p>
        <p>- The artwork should be based on an interaction between order and chaos</p>
        <p>- It can be considered an instructive art movement</p>
        <p>- iconization support</p>
        <p>- No absurdity, no coincidence, no contempt in art</p>
        <p>- The time has come to "function follow form"</p>
        <h2>2.3 iconization Characteristics:</h2>
        <p>- Extremism in the use of expressive and symbolic values</p>
        <p>- Stay away from classic concepts</p>
        <p>- In Fine Arts, the artist tries not to be comprehensive, but rather to find a special imprint that distinguishes his work</p>
        <p>- In architecture and design, there is a consistent interaction between the identity of the design product and the imprint of the designer or architect</p>
        <p>In the field of urban design, emphasis is placed on highlighting the identity of the project and its reflection on the designs of units and accessories of buildings and street furniture and the emergence of what are known as cities and iconic complexes such as the Citadel Outlets in Los Angeles, the Palm Islands in The United Arab Emirates and Putrajaya city in Malaysia.</p>
        <h2>3. The Conclusion</h2>
        <p>A phrase repeated by many sons of our generation that we are lucky to be the last generation that plays in the street and the first generation to own computers and cellular devices. The fact of the matter is that this generation has a huge responsibility, which is to draw the features of the near future at the very least. As a researcher interested in the art fields, I found that the role of arts and crafts in general has receded due to the inability to keep pace with technological progress. The artist’s product has become much less than the user/operator of the machine, in both quantitatively and qualitatively, and no one pays attention to the value of the craft, which is expected in any way (Zheng & Liu, 2017). Every year there are thousands of graduates from art institutions. Most of those have talents that deserve attention, but unfortunately, they do not find opportunities worthy of their qualifications/skills. In that case they only have two options, one worse than the other, either they accept a job level lower than their peers Graduates from specific technical or administrative specializations or looking for a job that is far from art fields. This tragedy is repeated without consideration by the decision- makers, as no need for these specializations, even there is no clear job title/description for the artist’s career. The solution lies in the necessity to resurrect, purify and re-create artistic activities in ways that keep pace with what digital development has been after designing clear and specific policies that protect the artist and the artistic product to care for this category of people. They are creative and they deserve care worthy of their talents and academic qualifications. The iconization was planned to be a philosophical entity that could crystallize in the form of an artistic institution and could be called a term for an artistic movement that attracts researchers and students in the field of art working in an organized way to ensure the survival of the art message as we have known it as a message characterized above the boundaries of time and space, otherwise we will expect decay and Art corrodes in branches in the coming decades, replacing them with digital applications and software, and the artist or designer will be replaced by a user/operator without any taste or artistic sense.</p>
        <h2 id=ST_5>The Logo</h2>
        <img src=https://i.ibb.co/hmTmcDV/GR-logo.png style=width:6vw>
        <p>In addition to the aesthetic value, there are a few philosophical purposes behind iconization logo design.</p>
        <li>iii The main feature of the logo is duplication of (i) character from iconization on other hand the three i’s represent three torches of knowledge, each torch refers to one of the three major fields in iconization institution (interior design, architecture and urban design)</li>
        <li>Color pattern: Black is associated with the power, strength, authority, elegance, formality, aggression, rebellion, and sophistication. Red is very emotionally intense color, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love.</li>
        <li>Hexagon shape is a symbol, usual appearance in equilateral, symmetrical form suggests a humanly relatable touch, and its nearness to circularity while still possessing angles make it all the more perfectly emblematic.</li>
        <li>Mathematical relationship, when dividing the length by the width, the result is equal to 1.6 it referrers to the Golden Ratio.</li>
        <li>The general shape of the logo represent the significant relationship between the two 3d objects what they are space and the mass, the most important design elements.</li>
        <li>The design is very flexible and capable of developing an iconization script (font) of writing.</li>
        <h2>The founder</h2>
        <p><img src=https://i.ibb.co/wR7Svqd/my-name.png style=width:10vw><br>Firas Al-Helli is an artist and a researcher, interested in art history teaching methods, thus he is always trying to find satisfactory answers that art students are frequently asking.</p>
        <p>He published some academic papers as contributions to several conferences related to arts of architecture and design. His book Auto-Showroom Design and the Visitors' Attention, was a cognitive contribution, a research book as an attempt to find a relationship between exhibition design and the visitor attention. He considers publishing an academic responsibility to provide references that support research, especially scarce majors in libraries such as arts of architecture and interior design. Firas holds MSc. in Interior Design, Bachelor degree in Design Arts, and Diploma in Statistics, He worked in different fields and business related to education, graphic/interior design and construction.</p>
